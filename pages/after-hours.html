<h1>After Hours Coverage</h1>

<p>If you would like to reach the on call physician about an urgent matter that cannot wait until the office opens, we are always available after 5 pm on weeknights, and all weekend long. To reach a physician please call our office at 617-232-2811. The on call physician will call you back within 60-90 minutes. If your concern cannot wait 60-90 minutes, please indicate that to our answering service and the call will be placed immediately. <strong>IF YOU DO NOT RECEIVE A CALL BACK IN THE EXPECTED TIME, PLEASE CALL OUR OFFICE AGAIN.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We are available to see your child for urgent medical issues only on Saturday, Sundays, and holidays.</p> We strongly discourage our patients from seeking urgent care anywhere else. These visits are by appointment only. Please call our office at 617-232-2811 and the on-call physician will call you back to either give you advice or schedule an office visit.</p>

<p>We do not use or respond to text messages or emails from patients. While we pride ourselves in using a highly up to date electronic medical record, we have found that when a family has medical questions, the best way to communicate is in person or by phone. We are always happy talk to you in person or by telephone.</p>

<p>For weekend appointments your child will be seen in our office or in the office of our weekend cross covering group.</p>
