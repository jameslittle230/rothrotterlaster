<h1>Office Policies</h1>

<p>We see patients from birth through graduation from college, or age 21 years. Each patient is special and we strive to give each patient the right level of care and attention. For that reason, each patient is always scheduled with his/her own physician. This ensures that your child will have a lasting and caring relationship with one physician for his/her entire childhood and adolescence.</p>

<p>We have a close, working relationship with the nation’s #1 children’s hospital, Boston Children’s Hospital. We are highly integrated both clinically and electronically with Boston Children’s and have a long history of good working relationships with many of the top rated specialists there.</p>

<p>Should your child need to be seen in an emergency department, we refer to Boston Children’s emergency room.</p>

<p>Should your child need a specialist, most of the specialists we refer to are affiliated with Boston Children’s Hospital.</p>

<p>In order to help maintain your child’s health we see your child yearly for a well child visit.</p>

<p>We strive for 100% vaccination rate according to the most up to date information from the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p>

<p>While we cannot accept walk-in visits, we are always happy to schedule appointments for our patients. To help our office function as efficiently as possible, we require 24 hours to cancel an appointment.  There is a charge for appointments missed without proper notice.</p>
