<h1>Insurance</h1>

<p>We accept many common insurance plans including Harvard Pilgrim, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Tufts, Aetna, and Fallon. If you have an insurance plan not listed here, please call our office to find out if we accept your insurance.</p>

<p>Copayments are due in full at the time of the office visit, as per all insurance policy guidelines.  This requirement applies to weekday and weekend office visits. <strong>If your child is accompanied by a non-parent to a visit, we are still required to collect the co-payment on the day of the visit. Please plan accordingly</strong></p>

<p>A $10.00 surcharge will be applied each month that we send a bill for a copayment.</p>

<p>If you are having financial difficulties, you may easily arrange a payment plan with our office manager.  While we cannot waive fees, we can always set up a monthly payment plan, should the need arise.</p>

<p>We will always try to discuss with you and resolve any outstanding charges older than 90 days.  If this is unsuccessful, we are required to send the account to a collection agency.</p>
