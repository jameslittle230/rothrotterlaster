<h1>Insurance</h1>

<p>We accept all major insurance plans. If you have any questions, please call our office to find out if we accept your insurance.</p>

<p>Copayments are due in full at the time of the office visit, as per all insurance policy guidelines.  This requirement applies to weekday and weekend office visits. <strong>If your child is accompanied by a non-parent to a visit, we are still required to collect the co-payment on the day of the visit. Please plan accordingly</strong></p>

<p>A $10.00 surcharge will be applied each month that we send a bill for a copayment.</p>

<p>If you are having financial difficulties, you may easily arrange a payment plan with our office manager.  While we cannot waive fees, we can always set up a monthly payment plan, should the need arise.</p>
