<h1>Referrals</h1>

<p>Please speak with your child's physician before making an appointment with a specialist since there are many conditions we can easily treat right in our office.</p>

<p>If you need to see a specialist please call our office and we will assist you in setting up a specialist appointment.</p>

<p>If your child needs to see a specialist, your insurance company may require a referral number prior to the visit.  Once you have made the appointment with the specialist, please contact our office with the following information:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your child's name, date of birth, and insurance policy information</li>
    <li>Name of the physician specialist who will be seeing your child</li>
    <li>The date of the specialist appointment</li>
    <li>The NPI number of the specialist (the specialist's office will tell you that number, so ask for the NPI number when you make the appointment).</li>
</ul>
