<h1>Referrals</h1>

<p>Please speak with your child's physician before making an appointment with a specialist since there are many conditions we can easily treat right in our office.</p>

<p>If your child needs to see a specialist, your insurance company may require a referral number prior to the visit.  Once you have made the appointment with the specialist, please contact our office with the following information:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your child's name, date of birth, and insurance policy information</li>
    <li>Name of the physician specialist who will be seeing your child</li>
    <li>The date of the specialist appointment</li>
    <li>The NPI number of the specialist (the specialist's office will tell you that number, so ask for the NPI number when you make the appointment).</li>
</ul>

<p>We have a dedicated email address for the exclusive purpose of managing referrals (this is not a secure email address and does not get forwarded to your physician at any time, so please do not use this email address for anything other than arranging the paperwork required for your specialist appointment).</p>
